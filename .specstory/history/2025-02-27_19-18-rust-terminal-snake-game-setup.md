## Rust Terminal Snake Game Setup (27/02/2025, 19:18:16)

_**User**_

unset ARGV0 and then initialise a cargo rust project in the current project folder for producing a terminal based game of snake using ratatui

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you set up a new Rust project for a snake game using Ratatui. First, I'll unset ARGV0 and then create a new Cargo project.

Let me run these commands in sequence:

---

_****_

```bash
unset ARGV0
```

```
mehows% 

```

---

_****_



Now, let's create a new Cargo project:

---

_****_

```bash
cargo init --bin
```

```
mehows% cargo init --bin
    Creating binary (application) package
note: see more `Cargo.toml` keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/refer
ence/manifest.html
mehows%
```

---

_****_



Now I'll update the `Cargo.toml` file to add the necessary dependencies for our snake game. We'll need ratatui for the terminal UI and other helpful crates:

---

_****_

```diff
  version = "0.1.0"
  edition = "2021"
+ authors = ["AI Snake Developer"]
+ description = "A terminal-based snake game using Ratatui"
  
  [dependencies]
+ ratatui = "0.24.0"
+ crossterm = "0.27.0"
+ rand = "0.8.5"
+ anyhow = "1.0.75"
  
```

---

_****_



Now, let's create a basic structure for our snake game. I'll create the main file with the initial setup:

---

_****_

```diff
- fn main() {
-     println!("Hello, world!");
+ use std::{
+     io,
+     time::{Duration, Instant},
+ };
+ use anyhow::Result;
+ use crossterm::{
+     event::{self, Event, KeyCode},
+     terminal::{disable_raw_mode, enable_raw_mode, EnterAlternateScreen, LeaveAlternateScreen},
+     ExecutableCommand,
+ };
+ use ratatui::{
+     prelude::*,
+     widgets::{Block, Borders, Paragraph},
+ };
+ 
+ struct Game {
+     snake: Vec<(u16, u16)>,
+     food: (u16, u16),
+     direction: Direction,
+     game_over: bool,
+ }
+ 
+ #[derive(PartialEq)]
+ enum Direction {
+     Up,
+     Down,
+     Left,
+     Right,
+ }
+ 
+ impl Game {
+     fn new() -> Self {
+         Self {
+             snake: vec![(2, 2)],
+             food: (5, 5),
+             direction: Direction::Right,
+             game_over: false,
+         }
+     }
+ 
+     fn update(&mut self) {
+         if self.game_over {
+             return;
+         }
+ 
+         let (head_x, head_y) = self.snake[0];
+         let new_head = match self.direction {
+             Direction::Up => (head_x, head_y.saturating_sub(1)),
+             Direction::Down => (head_x, head_y + 1),
+             Direction::Left => (head_x.saturating_sub(1), head_y),
+             Direction::Right => (head_x + 1, head_y),
+         };
+ 
+         self.snake.insert(0, new_head);
+         self.snake.pop();
+     }
+ }
+ 
+ fn main() -> Result<()> {
+     // Terminal initialization
+     enable_raw_mode()?;
+     io::stdout().execute(EnterAlternateScreen)?;
+     let mut terminal = Terminal::new(CrosstermBackend::new(io::stdout()))?;
+ 
+     // Game state
+     let mut game = Game::new();
+     let mut last_update = Instant::now();
+     let tick_rate = Duration::from_millis(100);
+ 
+     loop {

I've set up a basic snake game with the following features:
1. Terminal UI using Ratatui and Crossterm
2. Basic snake movement with arrow key controls
3. Simple game state management
4. Snake rendering using Unicode blocks
5. Food rendering using a dot character
6. Game loop with proper timing

You can now run the game using:

---

_****_

```bash
cargo run
```

```
ct { x: 0, y: 0, width: 95, height: 19 }                                                      │
│                                       note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable 
to display a backtrace                                                                        │
│                     %


```

I notice there's an error in the game. Let me fix the terminal handling to properly clean up resources:

---

I've made several improvements to the code:
1. Properly separated the game loop into its own function
2. Added bounds checking for snake and food rendering
3. Improved terminal cleanup handling
4. Fixed input polling timing
5. Added proper error handling

Let's try running the game again:

When the snake moves to the bottom or right of the screen it causes an error. Use the framesize to limit how far the snake can move


---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the game to prevent the snake from moving beyond the frame boundaries. We'll need to update both the `Game` struct and its `update` method to be aware of the frame size:

---

_****_

```diff
      direction: Direction,
      game_over: bool,
+     frame_size: (u16, u16),  // (width, height)
  }
  
              direction: Direction::Right,
              game_over: false,
+             frame_size: (0, 0),  // Will be updated when game starts
          }
      }
  
          let (head_x, head_y) = self.snake[0];
+         let (width, height) = self.frame_size;
+         
+         // Account for borders by subtracting 1 from boundaries
+         let max_x = width.saturating_sub(2);
+         let max_y = height.saturating_sub(2);
+ 
          let new_head = match self.direction {
              Direction::Up => (head_x, head_y.saturating_sub(1)),
-             Direction::Down => (head_x, head_y + 1),
+             Direction::Down => (head_x, if head_y >= max_y { max_y } else { head_y + 1 }),
              Direction::Left => (head_x.saturating_sub(1), head_y),
-             Direction::Right => (head_x + 1, head_y),
+             Direction::Right => (head_x, if head_x >= max_x { max_x } else { head_x + 1 }),
          };
+ 
+         // Check if snake hit the boundaries
+         if new_head.0 == 0 || new_head.0 >= max_x || new_head.1 == 0 || new_head.1 >= max_y {
+             self.game_over = true;
+             return;
+         }
  
          self.snake.insert(0, new_head);
          self.snake.pop();
      }
+ 
+     fn update_frame_size(&mut self, width: u16, height: u16) {
+         self.frame_size = (width, height);
+     }
  }
  
          terminal.draw(|frame| {
              let size = frame.size();
+             game.update_frame_size(size.width, size.height);
              
              // Draw game area
                  Rect::new(game.food.0, game.food.1, 1, 1),
              );
+ 
+             // Draw game over message if needed
+             if game.game_over {
+                 let game_over = Paragraph::new("Game Over! Press 'q' to quit")
+                     .alignment(Alignment::Center);
+                 frame.render_widget(
+                     game_over,
+                     Rect::new(
+                         size.width / 4,
+                         size.height / 2,
+                         size.width / 2,
+                         3,
+                     ),
+                 );
+             }
          })?;
  
```

I've made several important changes to fix the boundary issues:

1. Added `frame_size` to the `Game` struct to track the terminal dimensions
2. Created an `update_frame_size` method to keep the frame size current
3. Added boundary checking in the `update` method that:
   - Accounts for the border by subtracting 1 from the boundaries
   - Prevents the snake from moving beyond the screen edges
   - Sets `game_over` to true if the snake hits a boundary
4. Added a game over message that appears when the snake hits a boundary

The snake will now:
- Stop at screen boundaries instead of causing errors
- Show a game over message when hitting a wall
- Properly account for the border of the game area

Let's fix one more issue - the Right direction was incorrectly implemented. Let me fix that:

---

_****_

```diff
              Direction::Down => (head_x, if head_y >= max_y { max_y } else { head_y + 1 }),
              Direction::Left => (head_x.saturating_sub(1), head_y),
-             Direction::Right => (head_x, if head_x >= max_x { max_x } else { head_x + 1 }),
+             Direction::Right => (if head_x >= max_x { max_x } else { head_x + 1 }, head_y),
          };
  
```

---

_****_



Now the snake should properly:
1. Move right (the bug is fixed)
2. Stop at screen boundaries
3. Show game over when hitting walls
4. Stay within the game area borders

You can run the game with:

_**User**_

In game.update if the head of the snake is in the same position as the food, increase the snakes lenght by 1. 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the `update` method to handle food collection and snake growth. Instead of calling `pop()` when we hit food, we'll keep the tail segment to make the snake grow:

---

_****_

```diff
  
          self.snake.insert(0, new_head);
+         
+         // Check if snake ate the food
+         if new_head == self.food {
+             // Don't remove the tail to make the snake grow
+             // Generate new food position (for now just move it to a fixed position)
+             self.food = (5, 5); // We'll make this random later
+         } else {
+             // Remove tail only if food wasn't eaten
              self.snake.pop();
+         }
      }
  
```

---

_****_



Now let's add the ability to generate random food positions using the `rand` crate we already have in our dependencies:

---

_****_

```diff
      ExecutableCommand,
  };
+ use rand::Rng;
  use ratatui::{
      prelude::*,
          }
      }
+ 
+     fn generate_food(&mut self) {
+         let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
+         let (width, height) = self.frame_size;
+         
+         // Account for borders and ensure food is within playable area
+         let max_x = width.saturating_sub(2);
+         let max_y = height.saturating_sub(2);
+         
+         // Generate food position that's not on the snake
+         loop {
+             let new_food = (
+                 rng.gen_range(1..max_x),
+                 rng.gen_range(1..max_y),
+             );
+             
+             if !self.snake.contains(&new_food) {
+                 self.food = new_food;
+                 break;
+             }
+         }
+     }
  
      fn update(&mut self) {
          if new_head == self.food {
              // Don't remove the tail to make the snake grow
-             // Generate new food position (for now just move it to a fixed position)
-             self.food = (5, 5); // We'll make this random later
+             self.generate_food();
          } else {
              // Remove tail only if food wasn't eaten
```

---

_****_



I've made the following improvements:

1. Added food collection logic in the `update` method:
   - When the snake's head position matches the food position, the snake grows by not removing its tail
   - After eating food, a new food position is generated

2. Added a new `generate_food` method that:
   - Uses the `rand` crate to generate random positions
   - Ensures food appears within the playable area (accounting for borders)
   - Makes sure food doesn't spawn on the snake's body
   - Uses a loop to keep trying until a valid position is found

Now when you play the game:
1. The snake will grow by 1 segment each time it eats food
2. Food will appear in random positions within the game area
3. Food will never spawn on the snake's body
4. Food will always be within the playable area (not on borders)

Add support for multiple food on the screen at once by making Game.food a Hashset

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the game to support multiple food items using a HashSet. First, we need to add the HashSet import and then modify the Game struct and its methods:

          } else {
              // Remove tail only if food wasn't eaten

      }
  
  
              // Draw food

              // Draw game over message if needed

Now I need to update the drawing code in the main loop to handle multiple food items:

---

```diff
              }
  
-             // Draw food
+             // Draw all food items
              for &(x, y) in &game.food {
                  let food_cell = Paragraph::new("●");
```

---

_****_





The changes I've made include:

1. Added `HashSet` import and changed `food` field in `Game` struct to be a `HashSet<(u16, u16)>`
2. Modified `Game::new()` to initialize with multiple food items
3. Updated `generate_food()` to:
   - Try to find an empty spot up to 10 times
   - Check for collisions with both snake and existing food
   - Use `insert` instead of assignment
4. Updated `update()` method to:
   - Use `remove` to check if food was eaten
   - Generate new food when one is eaten
   - Maintain a minimum of 3 food items on screen
5. Updated the drawing code to iterate over all food items in the HashSet

The game now features:
- Multiple food items on screen at once
- At least 3 food items at all times
- Food items that don't overlap with each other or the snake
- Snake growth when eating any food item
- Automatic food replacement when one is eaten

I'll modify the code to pass the frame size during game initialization and remove the need for constant frame size updates:

  }
  
      let mut terminal = Terminal::new(CrosstermBackend::new(io::stdout()))?;
  
-     // Game state
-     let mut game = Game::new();
+     // Get initial terminal size
+     let size = terminal.size()?;
+     
+     // Game state initialization with frame size
+     let mut game = Game::new(size.width, size.height);
      let mut last_update = Instant::now();
      let tick_rate = Duration::from_millis(100);
          terminal.draw(|frame| {
              let size = frame.size();
-             game.update_frame_size(size.width, size.height);
              
              // Draw game area
```

---

_****_



I've made the following changes:

1. Modified `Game::new` to accept `width` and `height` parameters and initialize the frame size immediately
2. Removed the `update_frame_size` method as it's no longer needed
3. Moved the food initialization into `Game::new` so it happens once at startup
4. Updated the main function to:
   - Get the terminal size before creating the game instance
   - Pass the terminal size to `Game::new`
   - Remove the call to `update_frame_size` in the draw loop

These changes make the code more efficient and logically consistent since:
1. The frame size is set once at initialization
2. Food is generated only at startup (and when eaten)
3. We don't unnecessarily update the frame size every frame

The game will now maintain its initial frame size throughout the session. If you need to handle terminal resizing, that would need to be implemented separately, but for most terminal games, handling the initial size is sufficient.

randomize the starting position of the snake

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the `Game::new` method to randomize the snake's starting position within the playable area:

```diff
  impl Game {
      fn new(width: u16, height: u16) -> Self {
+         let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
+         
+         // Calculate playable area (accounting for borders)
+         let max_x = width.saturating_sub(2);
+         let max_y = height.saturating_sub(2);
+         
+         // Generate random starting position (ensuring we're not too close to borders)
+         let start_x = rng.gen_range(2..max_x-2);
+         let start_y = rng.gen_range(2..max_y-2);
+         
          let mut game = Self {
-             snake: vec![(2, 2)],
+             snake: vec![(start_x, start_y)],
              food: HashSet::new(),
              direction: Direction::Right,
```

---

_****_



I've updated the `Game::new` method to:

1. Create a random number generator
2. Calculate the playable area by accounting for borders
3. Generate random starting coordinates that are:
   - At least 2 units away from the left and top borders (`2..`)
   - At least 2 units away from the right and bottom borders (`..max_x-2`)
   - This ensures the snake has room to move in any direction at the start

The snake will now start at a random position within the safe area of the game board, making each game slightly different. The starting position is kept away from the borders to give the player time to react and control the snake.

You can run the game to see the random starting positions:

I've added two unit tests:

1. `test_generate_food_within_bounds`:
   - Creates a 20x20 game area
   - Generates 50 different food positions
   - Verifies that each food position is within the playable area (between 1 and 18 for both x and y coordinates, accounting for borders)
   - Includes descriptive error messages if assertions fail

2. `test_generate_food_not_on_snake`:
   - Creates a game with a snake in a specific pattern (L-shape)
   - Generates 50 different food positions
   - Verifies that none of the food positions overlap with any snake segment
   - Includes descriptive error messages showing both food and snake positions if assertions fail

I've completely rewritten the `generate_food` method to use a better approach:

1. First Attempt - Random Position:
   - Tries up to 100 times to find a random valid position
   - Uses direct random generation for x and y coordinates
   - Checks if the position is valid (not on snake or existing food)
   - Returns immediately if a valid position is found

2. Fallback - Systematic Search:
   - If random attempts fail, systematically searches the entire grid
   - Checks each position in sequence until finding a valid one
   - Guarantees finding a position if one exists
   - More efficient than continuing random attempts when space is limited

The key improvements are:
- Direct position generation instead of the previous modular arithmetic approach
- Explicit checks for snake and existing food positions
- Two-phase approach (random then systematic) for better efficiency
- No possibility of infinite loops
- Guaranteed to find a valid position if one exists

The tests should now pass because:
1. The food will never be placed on the snake
2. The positions will still be within bounds
3. The method will always find a valid position if one exists

Let's run the tests to verify:

refactor so that Game does not need to account for borders by subjecting 2 from its max/min width/height values. Instead when initialising the game, pass width/heigh in as 4 less then the frame width/height. Then also add 2 to snake/food positions when rendering them in terminal.draw

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll refactor the code to handle borders at the rendering layer rather than in the game logic. This will make the game logic cleaner and more focused on just the game rules:
